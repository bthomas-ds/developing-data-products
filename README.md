# Coursera Developing Data Products

For the course project I explored weighting the best place for seniors to retire rating from BankRate.com and the average temperature by state. Reverse rank scoring was used for the average temperature and the BankRate.com ratings. For example, the state with the highest average temperature would be scored as a 50. Adding the scores from the BankRate.com report and the average annual temperature resulted in the total score.

A data table was used to visualize the table data with a choropleth map below. While it should not be a surprise that Florida rated high, the top ten was composed of some suprises:

* Hawaii
* Florida
* Texas
* Arizona
*	South Carolina
*	New Mexico
*	Delaware
*	California
* North Carolina
* Virginia

The data table can be sorted by the columns so users can see while a state rated very high, it was there average annual temperature combination that brought them down in the rank scoring.
